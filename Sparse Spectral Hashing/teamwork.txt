------Contribution :

    Safwan Mahmood : Feature extraction from cluster of images, necessary pre-processing and integrating it to SPCA
                    resulting in feature vectors for respective images
    Sanjan Prakash : SPCA construction in detail. ADA boosting to learn the thresholds to be used for generating Hamming codes                      in an adaptive manner
    Aashish : Mapping of Euclidean space to Hamming space, i.e, constructing DELTA_KJ and further using it in
              implementation of Z(i,j) and generating binary code y(i) for i-th image in dataset
    Vibhas : Implemented calculation of Hamming Distance and also classification, i.e., dataset labeling

    Dataset folders :

    Program files and outputs :

    feature_exractor.py : This program is used to extract features for each image.
    It returns feature vectors with 2048 dimensions for each image, which are saved in mylist.csv
    
    boosting.py : This program learns the thresholds to be used to generate the binary Hamming codes in an adaptive manner.
    
    main.py : In this program sparsePCA is implemented and it returns the feature vector with reduced dimensions
    from 2048 to 1024, which is saved in n_components.csv. Also this program results in going from the mapping of
    Euclidean to Hamming space and generates a total of 3 files :
        n_components.csv : Feature vectors after dimension reduction
        z_values.csv : z(i,j)
        y_values.csv : y(i) binary code for i-th image in training set
